# My Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! This repository contains my personal configuration files for various tools and applications that I use on a daily basis. Below, you'll find details about my Neovim setup and Tmux configuration.

## Neovim Setup

My Neovim setup is based on [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) with some modifications to suit my workflow. LazyVim is a highly customizable and efficient Neovim configuration that provides a great starting point for building your own setup.

### Features

- **LazyVim Base**: The core of my Neovim setup is built on LazyVim, which offers a solid foundation with sensible defaults.
- **Custom Plugins**: I've added a few plugins to enhance my development experience like nvim-spider for more finegrained
  text navigation and diffview for displaying diffs.
- **Personal Keybindings**: Custom keybindings to improve my productivity.

## Tmux Configuration

In addition to my Neovim setup, this repository also includes my Tmux configuration. Tmux is a terminal multiplexer that allows you to manage multiple terminal sessions within a single window.

### Features

- **Custom Status Bar**: A personalized status bar with useful information.
- **Keybindings**: Custom keybindings for easier navigation and session management.
- **Session Management**: Scripts to save and restore Tmux sessions.
- **Vim shortcut navigation**: Seamlessly navigate between panes in neovim and tmux using vim shortcuts

### TPM (Tmux Plugin Manager)

I use [TPM (Tmux Plugin Manager)](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) to manage my Tmux plugins. TPM makes it easy to install, update, and remove Tmux plugins.
